# ScriptFodder Themes

##About

This is where I will place themes I've made for ScriptFodder (http://scriptfodder.com/). They're just general CSS modifications from ScriptFodder. You may edit them to your hearts' desire, whilst not listing them for profit.

##Credits

Billy - Telling me I'm dumb and forgot to use certain tags and making the Chrome extension
